1- check version of py in jupyter

from platform import python_version
python_version()

2- install nltk 

import sys
!{sys.executable} -m pip install nltk


3- working stopwords 

- download "stopwords"

>> import nltk
>> nltk.download("stopwords")


Example: Cross check with the stopwords 

- We have list of tuple : 

>> d_list

# We get the list of tuple [(5346, 'the'),
 # (2795, 'and'),
 # (2729, 'i'),
 # (2400, 'to'),]

These are have many works that it called stop words such as : is , a , this, the , go, to 

==> we do not count the stop work 
==> we do the cross check d_list and stopwords 

--------------------------------------------------

filtered_words = []
for (count, word) in d_list:
    if word not in english_stopwords:
        filtered_words.append((word, count))
filtered_words


--------------------------------------------------

if we want to add our list:

own_stopword = ['would','us','said','could','one','go']
filtered_words = []
for (count, word) in d_list:
    if word not in english_stopwords and word not in own_stopword:
        filtered_words.append((word, count))
filtered_words[:5]
