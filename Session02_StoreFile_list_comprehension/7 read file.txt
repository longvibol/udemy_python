with open("doc.txt") as file:
    print(file.read())

By default the open mode is 'r'

So we no need to put 'r' 

-------------------

Note on the read file :

with open("doc.txt") as file:
    file.read()
    print(file.read())


when it read the first line from : file.read() then after we use print(file.read()) it will show nothing !
