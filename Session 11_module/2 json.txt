1- Think what is the data structure look like 

==> List = what we store the same thing 
==> Dictionary : Key and Value 

var = [
    {"question": "What are dolphins", "alternatives": ["Amphibians", "Fish", "Mammals", "Birds"], "correct_answer": 3},
    {"question": "What occupies most of the Earth's surface", "alternatives": ["Land", "Water"], "correct_answer": 2}
    ]

This is what we store the variable in the python file. 


>> print(type(var))

>> <class 'list'>


2- We normally store in another file for the data (.json)

How to convert from json string to list :

2.1- read the file from the question.json 

-question.json :

[{"question": "What are dolphins", "alternatives": ["Amphibians", "Fish", "Mammals", "Birds"], "correct_answer": 3},
    {"question": "What occupies most of the Earth's surface", "alternatives": ["Land", "Water"], "correct_answer": 2}
]

-main.py

import json

with open('questions.json','r') as file:
    content = file.read()

print(content)
print(type(content)) 

==RESULT:

[{"question": "What are dolphins", "alternatives": ["Amphibians", "Fish", "Mammals", "Birds"], "correct_answer": 3},
    {"question": "What occupies most of the Earth's surface", "alternatives": ["Land", "Water"], "correct_answer": 2}
]
<class 'str'>

==> We can see the type is string what we want is list:

therefore, we use import json to convert from str to json 

+ main.py 

import json

with open('questions.json','r') as file:
    content = file.read()

data = json.loads(content)
print(data)
print(type(data))

==Result is list 

[{'question': 'What are dolphins', 'alternatives': ['Amphibians', 'Fish', 'Mammals', 'Birds'], 'correct_answer': 3}, {'question': "What occupies most of the Earth's surface", 'alternatives': ['Land', 'Water'], 'correct_answer': 2}]
<class 'list'>
