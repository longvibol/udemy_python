1- main file 

from functions import get_todos, write_todos

When called : todos = get_todos()

==> this option when we have more function we need to called them one by one 

Or this is recommend : 

import functions (this is called module)

when called :  todos = functions.get_todos()

==> easy to use and we just all the parent 

2- in the functions 

if we write print in the work space :

def get_todos(filepath = "files/todos.txt"):
    """ Read a text file and return the list of todos """
    with open(filepath, "r") as file_local:
        todos_local = file_local.readlines()
    return todos_local

# procedure
def write_todos(todos_arg, filepath = "files/todos.txt"):
    """ Write a text file to a list of todos """
    with open(filepath, "w") as file_local:
        file_local.writelines(todos_arg)

print("Hello")

===>

when we run in the main.py it will print : "Hello" 

and it is from our import function therefore we don't want to show it in the main.py we want it to work only inside their own function!


print(__name__)
print("Hello")

==> result :

__main__
Hello


and type it is the string :

<class 'str'>
Hello

solution we put the if statement 

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(__name__)
    print("Hello")

        todos_local = file_local.readlines()
    return todos_local
