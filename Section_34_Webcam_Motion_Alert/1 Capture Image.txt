1- Capture image 

Every 1 second have 30 images capture 

Note

library glob : use for collect stm to the list 

Ex: 

We have image extension .jpg 

==> we want to collect them to the list 

>>> import glob
>>> all_images = glob.glob(f"images/*.png")
>>> all_images


['images\\1.jpg', 'images\\10.jpg', 'images\\11.jpg', 'images\\12.jpg']


2- Concept : we want to save the best clear photo : it is always around the middle 

- find the amount of object image capture : then convert it to the integer (find the index from the list]

all_images = glob.glob(f"images/*.png")
index = int(len(all_images)/2)
image_with_object = all_images[index]
